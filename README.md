## What is Cake?
Cake is a *really* thin, drop-in replacement/wrapper around `make` that runs all
of your targets inside of a development Docker/Podman container.

### Vision
- Though Cake supports more complex workflows, most projects that currently have
  a `Makefile` at their root should also place a developer-focused `Dockerfile`
  there for convenience and portability
  - The `Makefile` is the single source of truth for the build process
  - The `Dockerfile` is the single source of truth for the build environment
- A container runtime should not be a hard dependency to build the project.
- Choosing between containerized and "naked" builds should be as easy as typing
  `make` or `cake` interchangeably 
- CI/CD pipelines should be able to reuse the instructions from the `Makefile`
  in an ergonomic way without having to keep the build context in mind
    
## Why Cake?
Because I found myself constantly writing Makefiles that run their targets in a
container, then adding in add-hoc ways for people not to use the container
through environment variables, followed by a half-hearted attempt at
optimizations through bind-mounts and less frequent restarts, and some faulty
logic to avoid name and tag clashes. I figured it was time to extract this into
a script. Despite its simplicity, the script covers 99% of my use cases for
tools like [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) without being tied to a specific
forge.

## Installation
To install use following command:

```bash
sudo curl -L -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wurosh/cake/master/cake" -o /usr/local/bin/cake && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cake
```

or 

```bash
curl -L -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wurosh/cake/master/cake" -o ~/.local/bin/cake && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cake
```

Ensure environment variable `PATH` includes `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin/` accordingly.

## How-To
Just use `cake` instead of `make`. The defaults should fit most use cases.

If you really have to, you can specify additional `docker`/`podman` arguments
using `$CAKE_RUNTIME_ARGS`. I recommend placing these in your
[.envrc](https://direnv.net/) if you need them to stick around due to the
specific needs of your project.

If you're building/testing your software against multiple environments, you can
always set `$CAKE_DOCKERFILES` (defaults to Make's `${PWD}/Dockerfile` - which
is not necessarily the same as your shell's `${PWD}/Dockerfile`). This will run
your Make targets in one container per `Dockerfile`. If `$CAKE_DOCKERFILES` is a
directory, all `Dockerfile`s in that directory (and all of its sub-directories)
will be used. This is the one area in which Cake diverges from Make. You have to
specify Cake-relevant environment variables before the command, not after. You
can take a look at some of my test cases for example invocations:

``` sh
cake
cake all
cake -C subdir
CAKE_DOCKERFILES='subdir/' cake
CAKE_DOCKERFILES='subdir/Dockerfile' cake
CAKE_DOCKERFILES='subdir/one.dockerfile subdir/Dockerfile' cake
```


## Tips
If I want to debug my development container, I like to add a `shell` target
to my `Makefile` like so:
``` makefile
shell:
    /bin/sh
```
It's more ergonomic then copying the container name.


The same goes for dealing with things like `./autogen.sh` and the `./configure`
script (often managed directly by the user). I tend to call those through a
`Makefile` as well. Take this snippet from the `GNUMakefile` in the Emacs source
tree as an example:

``` makefile
configure:
	@echo >&2 'There seems to be no "configure" file in this directory.'
	@echo >&2 Running ./autogen.sh ...
	./autogen.sh
	@echo >&2 '"configure" file built.'

Makefile: configure
	@echo >&2 'There seems to be no Makefile in this directory.'
	@echo >&2 'Running ./configure ...'
	./configure
	@echo >&2 'Makefile built.'

# 'make bootstrap' in a fresh checkout needn't run 'configure' twice.
bootstrap: Makefile
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile all
```

### Why POSIX sh
Because additional dependencies are a problem, especially in corporate
environments. just `curl`/copy this script into a directory on your `$PATH` and
you're good to go.

## Completions
I might provide them for convenience later, but in principle all you need to do
is reuse existing make completions. In `zsh` that looks something like this:
``` zsh
compdef _make cake
```
